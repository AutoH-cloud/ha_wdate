# **WTime**

## **Custom Integration for Home Assistant**

**WTime** is a custom integration for Home Assistant that provides a variety of sensors related to time and dates, including Daylight Saving Time (DST) status, current seasons, and more. It's perfect for displaying time-based information on your Home Assistant dashboard and creating automations based on DST status or seasons.

## **Available Sensors**

- **Clock**: Displays the current time in a 12 and in 24-hour format, with and without seconds (updated in real time).
- **Date**: Displays the current date (e.g., December 1, 2024).
- **Date (Short)**: Displays the current date in numeric format (e.g., 12/01/24).
- **Current Month**: Displays the current month (useful for automations).
- **DST Status**: Indicates whether Daylight Saving Time (DST) is currently active.
- **Current Season**: Displays the current season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).

## **Automation Examples**

### **Example 1: Notify When DST Changes**
This automation sends a notification whenever Daylight Saving Time (DST) status changes.

```yaml
alias: Notify DST Change
description: "Send a notification when DST status changes"
trigger:
- platform: state
 entity_id: sensor.Wtime_dst_status
condition: []
action:
- service: notify.mobile_app
 data:
   title: "DST Status Changed"
   message: >
     Daylight Saving Time is now {{ states('sensor.wtime_dst_status') }}.
mode: single
```

### **Example 2: Adjust Thermostat Based on Season**
This automation adjusts the thermostat based on the current season.
```yaml
alias: Adjust Thermostat by Season
description: "Set thermostat settings based on the current season"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.wtime_current_season
condition: []
action:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.wtime_current_season
            state: "Winter"
        sequence:
          - service: climate.set_temperature
            target:
              entity_id: climate.home_thermostat
            data:
              temperature: 22
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.wtime_current_season
            state: "Summer"
        sequence:
          - service: climate.set_temperature
            target:
              entity_id: climate.home_thermostat
            data:
              temperature: 24
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.wtime_current_season
            state: "Spring"
        sequence:
          - service: climate.set_temperature
            target:
              entity_id: climate.home_thermostat
            data:
              temperature: 21
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.wtime_current_season
            state: "Fall"
        sequence:
          - service: climate.set_temperature
            target:
              entity_id: climate.home_thermostat
            data:
              temperature: 20
mode: single
```

To disable recording history and lookback for the clock sensors, add the below in the ```configuration.yaml``` file.
```
recorder:
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.wtime_12hr_clock
      - sensor.wtime_12hr_clock_with_seconds
      - sensor.wtime_24hr_clock
      - sensor.wtime_24hr_clock_with_seconds
      - sensor.wtime_date
      - sensor.wtime_date_short
      - sensor.wtime_weekday
      - sensor.wtime_weekday_short
```
